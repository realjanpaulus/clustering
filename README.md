# clustering
Clustering files for the course "Clustering" at the Julius-Maximilians University WÃ¼rzburg, SS20.


## Project structure

**app**: Contains Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks and the json file `epochs.json`.
- `epochs.json`: Stores multiple different literature epoch divisions.
- `epochs_addition.json`: Special extension of the epoch division of AMANN.
- `create_linkage.py`: Script for the creation of a linkage matrix.
- `mlclf_lsvm.py`: Script for the experiments with LSVM.
- `pipe.py`: A pipeline for multiple clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models. Applies selected clustering algorithm to a specific corpus, a specific epoch division method and two selected epochs. For more informations about the possible input arguments run the following command in a terminal: `python pipe.py -h`. 
- `run_pipe.py`: Runs `pipe.py` for every possible combination of epochs. For more informations about the possible input arguments run the following command in a terminal: `python run_pipe.py -h`. 
- `utils.py`: Stores helper functions for clustering experiments.
- `clustering_whole_corpus.ipynb`: Clustering of the whole corpus and plotting data points and their allocation.
- `corpus_modification.ipynb`: Modification of the corpus by adding epoch division, merging poets and improving epoch division. Show corpus token count 
distribution. 
- `evaluation.ipynb`: Calculates scores for clustering results, sorts and summarizes them.
- `hierarchical_clustering.ipynb`: Hierarchical Clustering experiments.
- `noise_detection.ipynb`: Various experiments to reduce the noise.


**corpora**: Contains text corpora in csv files.

**presentation**: Contains the presentation for the clustering experiments.

**results**: Contains the experiment results as images and json files.


## Connection of presentation and repository

The **appendix** of the presentation (see "presentation" folder) contains an assignment of the presented experiments to the scripts in the "app" folder.
